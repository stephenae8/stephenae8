## Hi there 👋

My name is Stephen Aekins, and I'm a software developer who recently graduated from Tech Elevator with a strong background in IT infrastructure and services. My aim is to deliver products that remove stressors and blockers to streamline lives.


- 🛠️ I recently built [**Reality Site**](realitysite.netlify.app)
  - An app that simplifies property management by allowing users to apply for, list, and manage properties. Worked collaboratively with the product owner and team(as team lead) to build a user-friendly interface tailored for both property owners, managers, and applicants. Utilized Vue.js, Java, Spring Boot, Postman, and PostgreSQL. On this project, I developed SQL database, designed RESTful API and webpage layouts and created the property filtering system with dropdown menus.

- 🔬 I’m currently working on **Vision** 🔮
  - A self-improvement and productivity app designed to clarify your thoughts with categorized notes, mark your calendar, and set achievable goals called 'Actions'. Coupled with an AI co-pilot to assist with cataloging and recalling your ideas, journaling prompts, goal completion plans and more- Vision empowers you to take control of your life and stay focused on what matters most. **Vision — Achieve clarity**.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning
   - AWS, Containerization, and how to optimally deploy applications to the cloud
   - React.js through a team project, Midl, powered by the Google Maps API.
